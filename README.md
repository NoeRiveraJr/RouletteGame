Creating a game roulette that will display all of the possible winning bets as if it were a real roulette table.

Hi, I'm Noe Rivera Jr., this project involves a simulation of a roulette table. The purpose of the project is to display all the possible winning bets when a random bin from the roulette table is selected. Here are the 10 bets we needed to display:
1. Numbers: the number of the bin
2. Evens/Odds: even or odd numbers
3. Reds/Blacks: red or black colored numbers
4. Lows/Highs: low (1 – 18) or high (19 – 38) numbers.
5. Dozens: row thirds, 1 – 12, 13 – 24, 25 – 36
6. Columns: first, second, or third columns
7. Street: rows, e.g., 1/2/3 or 22/23/24
8. 6 Numbers: double rows, e.g., 1/2/3/4/5/6 or 22/23/24/25/26/26
9. Split: at the edge of any two contiguous numbers, e.g., 1/2, 11/14, and 35/36
10. Corner: at the intersection of any four contiguous numbers, e.g., 1/2/4/5, or 23/24/26/27

I mainly used 2 arrays, one for the numbers of the roulette table(0,00, and 1 - 36) and one for the colors that each number has(red, black, or green for 0, and 00). I created methods for every bet except the first bet. It was a challenging project that really emphasized critcal thinking to retrieve the winning bets for the bottom half of the required bets.
